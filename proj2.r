#Content of strategy1-Each prisoner starts from the box with the same number 
#as himself, and then opens the next box based on the card number in that box.

#Loop in turn until the prisoner finds a card with the same number as himself 
#or ends after looping n times.


##function "strategy1" is the code implementation of strategy1.

# The input to this function is:

#n: The prisoner can open the box at most n times, and the number of prisoners, 
#boxes and cards is 2n.

#k: Prisoner's number.

#box: distribution of 2n cards randomly assigned in 2n boxes.

##The output of this function is:

# Whether the prisoner found the correct card, if found, return the number "1", 
#otherwise return the number "0".

##Variable explanation in function:

#"found" indicates whether the prisoner found the correct card, the initial value 
#of 0 indicates that it was not found.

#"count" is used to count the number of times the prisoner opens the box, 
#the initial value is 1.

#"card_num" indicates the card number in the box opened each time, if card_num==k, 
#it means the prisoner finds a card with the same number as himself.

strategy1<-function(n,k,box){
  found<-0        
  count<-1        
  card_num<-box[k]        
  while (count<=n) {
    if (card_num==k) {
