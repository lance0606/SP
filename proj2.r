##function "strategy1" is the code implementation of strategy1.

##Variable explanation in function:

#"count" is used to count the number of times the prisoner opens the box, 
#the initial value is 1.

#"card_num" indicates the card number in the box opened each time, if card_num==k, 
#it means the prisoner finds a card with the same number as himself.

##Remarks about the surprising results:

#According to the results above, we can find that the individual probability for
#choosing 3 different strategies are close to be same, but the joint success
#probability distribution for choosing 3 strategies are very different. When
#prisoners choose strategy1, there are about 30% probability that they can all
#freed, while there is no chance for choosing strategy 2 and 3.
