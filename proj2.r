##Remarks about the surprising results:

#According to the results above, we can find that the individual probability for
#choosing 3 different strategies are close to be same, but the joint success
#probability distribution for choosing 3 strategies are very different. When
#prisoners choose strategy1, there are about 30% probability that they can all
#freed, while there is no chance for choosing strategy 2 and 3.
